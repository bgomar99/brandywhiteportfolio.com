There were only supposed to be a total of three colors so I made sure to use it sparingly and make sure that they would stand out. I used a yellow happy on the head to show as a happy person and a red compassionate to show a compassionate heart. Each would have a different size and different fonts with the most important ones being the largest to attract the eyes. </td>

Finding a way to show the features of the children looking shocked as they stare out and see the colony was tricky. Although I knew I didn't want the children to be the primary focus, I had to give them an appropriate reaction to seeing out in space for the first time. I settled on just the silhouette and to make the window the frame.</td>

Using only found images, I had to blend the different images together to make it look like it had been photographed. It was one of the first assignments I had ever created so it was very difficult to learn how to cut, layer and blend so it would look natural. The collar was possibly the hardest part as I had to fix the fur on the monkey's neck to make it look as if the shirt was sitting correctly on him.   </td>

			<td>TThis poster was the second of a three part series to create anthropomorphic animals for Safari days at the San Diego Zoo. For this design I wanted to create more of a cool guy look, so I decided to go with a cheetah for the animal and give him more of a hipster explorer look. It was very difficult to create a human-like expression for the cheetah so I decided to add some glasses and use his "smile" as the facial expression. If I was to redo the poster I would definitely move the text to make it look like it isn't all crowded at the edge of the poster.  </td>

We had much more leeway with this as the only criteria was that it had to fit the size of a Billboard. As the San Diego zoo was working on their polar Bear exhibit so I decided to run with that. I had a bit of trouble creating a slogan for my billboard but once I decided on Summer just got cooler, the fun in the sun looking for the billboard was easy to design. </td>

The task was to create a Yeti banner that the class would vote on and the winner would be used as the background for our class's canvas bulletin board. I had some trouble coming up with a realistic design for the yeti and after many different sketches I decided to go with a more cartoonish look to it.  Instead of forcing a realistic design I decided to create a fun little cartoon. I thought it would be a cute idea for a hot chocolate hot tub and I added little marshmallows and a little cabin.
